### binpacking-genetic-algorithm
An implementation of Falkenauer's grouping genetic algorithm to solve one-dimensional bin-packing.

The initial population is generated by starting at a random position in the item array and applying First-Fit.

Crossover is simply BPCX using First-Fit to place the remaining items.

Mutation probabilistically deletes random bins in every chromosome and places the items back into the chromosome using First-Fit.

An "inversion operator" is added, but it isn't sophisticated. It merely sorts the bins in ascending order.

The mating pool is selected through tournament selection with a tournament size of 2.

The child population completely replaces the previous population except for the single most fit chromosome from the previous population.
